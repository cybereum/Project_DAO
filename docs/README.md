# Project_DAO Knowledge Base

> **LLM-maintained knowledge base for the Cybereum protocol, NEXUS app, and agent economy.**
> This wiki is designed for both human and AI agent consumption. Index files (`_index.md`) in each directory provide summaries and navigation for LLM context efficiency.

## How This Knowledge Base Works

This follows the **LLM knowledge base pattern**: structured markdown files organized into a navigable wiki, with index files for fast discovery, cross-links between related topics, and a raw ingestion pipeline for new material.

- **Index files** (`_index.md`) in each directory list all articles with one-line summaries — LLMs read these first to decide what to deep-dive into
- **Backlinks** at the bottom of each article connect related topics
- **Raw intake** (`raw/`) is where new source material lands before being compiled into the wiki
- **Reviews and TODOs** are tracked centrally and linked from relevant articles
- The knowledge base grows incrementally — new articles are added as the project evolves

## Relationship to Root-Level Docs

The root-level `.md` files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.) remain the **primary entry points** for developers and AI agents cloning the repo. This `docs/` knowledge base is a **deeper, cross-linked, and growing** companion that:

- Organizes the same information by topic rather than by audience
- Adds theoretical and research context that doesn't belong in operational docs
- Tracks reviews, TODOs, and ongoing investigations
- Serves as a queryable wiki for LLM-assisted research and Q&A

## Contributing to the Knowledge Base

### For LLM agents
1. Drop new source material into `raw/` and update `raw/_index.md`
2. Compile relevant content into the appropriate section
3. Update the section's `_index.md` with a one-line summary
4. Add backlinks to related articles
5. Run a periodic health check: look for broken links, stale content, missing cross-references

### For humans
1. Use Obsidian or any markdown editor to browse and edit
2. The `_index.md` files serve as table-of-contents for each section
3. File issues or add TODOs to `_todo.md` for things that need attention
